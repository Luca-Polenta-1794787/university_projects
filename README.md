## Bachelor degree
- **Laboratorio di Intelligenza Artificiale e Robotica:** A set of [homeworks](./Bachelor%20Degree/Laboratorio%20di%20Intelligenza%20Artificiale%20e%20Robotica) about interacting with a robotic mobile base, executing a task, image processing, computer vision and planning delivered during the second semester of the third year of the bachelor degree.
- **Linguaggi e Tecnologie Per il Web:** A [project](./Bachelor%20Degree/Linguaggi%20e%20Tecnologie%20Per%20il%20Web) that deals with the creation of a website in which the main features of the languages used for web development are exploited, including HTML, Javascript, CSS, PHP, AJAX and SQL. In addition, some additional Javascript-based libraries have been used to manage the shopping cart and to simplify the use of Javascript at a high level. Such libraries are jQuery and Vue.js .
- **Metodi Quantitativi per l'Informatica:** A Computer Vision [project](./Bachelor%20Degree/Metodi%20Quantitativi%20Per%20L'Informatica) in which two neural networks are trained to correctly recognize a wide range of road signs. 
- **Thesis:** My bachelor degree's [Final Thesis](./Bachelor%20Degree/Thesis) "Detection e Recognition di cartelli stradali: combinazione di rete neurale e approcci geometrici". Starting from the best neural network trained in the project of the "Metodi Quantitativi per l'Informatica" course, a system has been developed that is able to identify and recognize round and triangular road signs. The identification of road signs in a generic image rich of elements is carried out through geometric filters, while the recognition is carried out by a previously trained neural network.

## Master degree

- **Fundalmental in Computer Graphics:** Three homeworks carried out during the course about modeling and rendering three-dimensional scenes: a Ray tracer [HW1](./Master%20Degree/Fundamental%20of%20Computer%20Graphics/HW1), a Path tracer [HW2](./Master%20Degree/Fundamental%20of%20Computer%20Graphics/HW2) and a Volumetric Path tracer [HW3](./Master%20Degree/Fundamental%20of%20Computer%20Graphics/HW3) have been developed using YoctoGL.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** In the field of reinforcement learning, a [homework](./Master%20Degree/Reinforcement%20Learning/Homework) and a [final project](./Master%20Degree/Reinforcement%20Learning/Project) were carried out. The first was an approach to OpenAI Gym, while the project based on a neural network that applies the TRPO Reinforcement Learning algorithm in order to let a half cheetah learn how to trot in the MuJoCo Advanced physics simulation of OpenAI Gym. 
- **Neural Networks:** A Computer Vision project on [Object Classification](./Master%20Degree/Neural%20Networks) that exploits the VGG16 and MobileNetV2 architectures for prediction of Alzheimer's Disease. In addition, a series of features have been implemented into the code in order to improve the results. The project aims to compare and analyze the results obtained.
- **Interactive Graphics:** In this field, two homeworks and a project were carried out. The two homework assignements, [HW1](./Master%20Degree/Interactive%20Graphics/Homework%201) and [HW2](./Master%20Degree/Interactive%20Graphics/Homework%202), show the basic use of webGL for creating 3D scenes with lights and animations. The [final project](./Master%20Degree/Interactive%20Graphics/Project) is a simplified remake of the "Crossy Road" game. It was achieved by programming in webGL through the ThreeJS framework. The game has the following features: a hierarchical model automatically generated for each level and used to organize, manage and interact with all the elements in the world; lights and textures of various types to generate scenes in various lighting conditions or high realism through the bump mapping technique; manually designed animations for the characters animated by the user and the environment that animates autonomously.
- **Vision and Perception:** In this field, two homeworks and a project were carried out. The two homework assignements were on [Image Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_processing) and Multiview Geometry ([Projective Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry)), while [the project](./Master%20Degree/Vision%20And%20Perception) is based on the creation of a generative model from a single natural image. The neural network is based on SinGAN, which is made up by a pyramid of generators that are trained on an image pyramid obtained by downsampling the single training image. The aim of the project is to apply SinGAN in the medical field to increase the images of the datasets used in this field in a realistic way. 
- **Mobile Applications & Cloud Computing:** In this project, an android app was developed in Kotlin/Java through the use of Android Studio. The features it had to have are as follows: use of graphics components; multi-users; use of cloud services either pre-existing and created from scratch; use of sensors; concurrency. All files on the app and on the server created from scratch can be found at the following [link](./Master%20Degree/Mobile%20Applications%20&%20Cloud%20Computing).
